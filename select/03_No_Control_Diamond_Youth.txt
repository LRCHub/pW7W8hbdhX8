Go and inspire with me,
Going somewhere else
So I'll wait for all this to come crashing down
Go and inspire with me,
Going somewhere else
So I'll wait for all this to come crashing down

I never look down
If you never look down
So why are we now holding our???

Just for the feeling of letting go
Just for the feeling of no control
Feels like we're turning in
Turning mystify
When it all but breaks and takes a running
Out, oho
'Cause I'll never go walking
The way you want me now
So I'll wait for all this to come crashing down
So I'll wait for all this to come crashing down

Just for the feeling of letting go
Just for the feeling of no control
Feels like we're turning in
Turning mystify
When it all but breaks and takes a running
Out, oho

I never look down
If you never look down
So hold it all in now
You hold it all in now

I never look down
If you never look down
So hold it all in now
You hold it all in now
You hold it all in now

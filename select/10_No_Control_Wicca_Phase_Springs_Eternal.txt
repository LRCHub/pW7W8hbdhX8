Let me see the plans that you laid for yourself
I got it
Even though yr late i'll be fine
Red sky cries but the baby's still right
And you put it all up in my hands
Let me turn it on until you say it's time to fold
I know
No control over you no
Heart beats slow
No control

And you got me like that...
I said it's not right

Do you wanna see the back of an amazing time
Set it on fire
And tell me what you want...
No conversation with the blade
I was in la
California phase
Baby

I remember setting off the past
You kept jumping me, you know it's like that
You found me in phases in the hallway in the back
You put me in debt
I know that my sex is the best

Come on come on
Showing me yr legs baby open up yr arms
I swear
Now i'm passing out in gold bar
With the club lights beating on me hard
Tell me what you want
Is it for the icy crystals settle on your neck
****** it's freezing outside
But you know i'm down to ride
You know that i'm down to die

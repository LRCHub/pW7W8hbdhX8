(Oh oh oh)
Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of
lipstick’s not enough
Sweet where you lay,
Still a trace of innocence on
my pillowcase
Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedals down, my eyes are
closed
No control
(Oh oh oh)
Taste on my tongue
I don't wanna wash away
the night before
In the heat where you lay
I could stay right here and
burn in it all day
Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedals down, my eyes are
closed
No control
Lost my senses
I'm defenseless
Her perfumes holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devour
Lying here I count the hours
Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedals down, my eyes are
closed
No control
(Oh oh oh)
No control
(Oh oh oh)
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedals down, my eyes are
closed
No control
